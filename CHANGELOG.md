- **Jailbreak Prevention**: Protection against DAN, STAN, and other techniques
- **Unicode Protection**: Homoglyph and zero-width character detection
- **Output Validation**: Ensures LLM responses haven't been compromised
- **Configurable Security**: Adjustable security levels
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in production environments

**Security Features:**
- Prompt injection detection and prevention
- Jailbreak technique detection

## Migration Guide

### Getting Started

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. Here's how to get started:

```rust
use llm_security::{LLMSecurityLayer, LLMSecurityConfig};

// Create security layer
let security = LLMSecurityLayer::new(LLMSecurityConfig::default());

// Sanitize input before sending to LLM
let safe_input = security.sanitize_code_for_llm(user_input)?;

// Validate LLM output
security.validate_llm_output(llm_response)?;
```

### Configuration

```rust
let config = LLMSecurityConfig {
    enable_injection_detection: true,
    enable_output_validation: true,
    max_code_size_bytes: 500_000,
    strict_mode: true,
    log_attacks: true,
    max_llm_calls_per_hour: 50,
};
```

- RTL override (U+202E)
- Homoglyphs (visually similar characters)
- Full-width character variants

### Social Engineering
- False authorization claims
